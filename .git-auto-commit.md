# Auto-Commit Setup for ChessBoard

## Quick Commit Script

**To automatically commit all your changes, run:**
```powershell
.\auto-commit.ps1
```

This script will:
- Stage all changes
- Create a commit with timestamp
- Show recent commits

## Manual Commit

If you prefer manual control:
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Auto-Commit on Save (Optional)

### Option 1: VS Code Extension
Install "GitDoc" extension in VS Code to auto-commit on save.

### Option 2: File Watcher Script
Create a file watcher that runs `auto-commit.ps1` when files change.

### Option 3: Git Hooks
Set up a post-commit hook (though this commits after you commit, not automatically).

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Backup Strategy:**
- Always push to remote repository regularly: `git push`
- The auto-commit script only commits locally
- To push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

## Current Git Status

Check your git status anytime:
```powershell
git status
```

View commit history:
```powershell
git log --oneline
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `.\auto-commit.ps1` to save your work
3. Periodically push to remote: `git push origin main`
4. If you want to push automatically, modify `auto-commit.ps1` to include `git push`
